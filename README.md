# EmailSender :e-mail:

The objective of the project is to send e-mails using python. To build the project, it was necessary to work with the SMTP protocol for sending emails, the SSL protocol for security and the Tkinter library as a graphical interface. 
> It is recommended that the sender's email address is a Gmail. If the email address is Hotmail or Yahoo Mail, you need to make a few simple changes to the code.
